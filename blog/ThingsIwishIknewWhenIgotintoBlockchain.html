            <h1>Things I wish I knew When I Got Into
                Blockchain</h1>
            <p>I learned about Blockchain more than a year ago and during that time I learned a lot of things and I was
                thinking what is an article I wish I read that would help me to accelerate my learning and get more
                value and this is what is this article about.</p>
            <h4><b>The Foundations:</b></h4>
            <p>
                I can't stress this enough but I think one of the things that could save me a lot of time if I spent
                some time, in the beginning, to become a better coder, have some understanding of some computer science
                stuff, and read some history, if you check the Bitcoin's Academic Pedigree, you see that Bitcoin was a
                result of a lot of research and experiments and understanding this can give you an idea how much
                computer science was used to have Bitcoin so for that resoan I think you should be spending a little
                time at the beginning on topics like Cryptography, Distributed Systems, and Security and some time on
                Economics and Game Theory and then keep learning more about them along the way. one thing that could
                help me if I knew what First Principles (check <a
                    href="https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/">this</a> article) are so I can have a tool to know
                what makes
                sense and what doesn't and it can help when you're trying to go deep into an idea. don't spend a lot of
                time on the theory, maybe just the first two months, and then only spend 20-30% of the time.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Build Things:</b></h4>
            <p>
                <i>Richard Feynman said, “What I cannot create I do not understand”</i> and that should be the rule you
                follow,
                you should be spending most of your time building Proof-of-Concepts of the ideas you're learning, things
                will be tough, it's not easy to build a bitcoin wallet, SegWit or a Proof-of-Work PoC but I guarantee
                you won't understand those things until you build them with the minimum amount of libraries. I think it
                feels a little bad at the beginning that you're building things that no one looking at or using but
                that's the only way you'll be building cool things in the future, start small and then build something
                cool. sometimes, I spent the whole day in the same function and nothing worked but when it worked a few
                days after it gets solved, you'll really understand that cryptography function or that networking part,
                the only thing that you have to do is don't stop. One other thing I learned it in the hard way, don't
                copy or look into other people's code why you're learning that won't give you the full value of the
                experience!
            </p>
            <h4><b>Contribute to Open Source:</b></h4>
            <p>
                The single most common advice that you'll get from people is contributing to open-source projects and
                this really the hardest part, I think one of the things you have to do after some few months is picking
                a project, you're really excited about, set a meeting with someone working on it and try to get some
                mentoring to contribute to it, the most important part here is the commitment, don't even try to set
                excuses, if you do, you'll find an excuse with every project you try to contribute to, so just commit
                for 3 months that you'll spend 6 hours a day trying to contribute to that project. one thing I think you
                should do is start with an issue right away, I guarantee you won't get value from reading the code as
                much as when you set it on your environment and start trying to do that issue. Also, I think this way
                that 90% of people in the crypto space got internships or jobs from.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Don't Get Distracted, Boring Stuff are More Exciting:</b></h4>
            <p>
                There will be a lot of hype (price, funding, celebrity tweeting, halving) and it's so distracting and
                may be exciting but the thing that really matters at the end is the code you push that people use! you
                should be focusing on the important stuff and not be following the trend, it mostly will disappear after
                a year or something, one of the reasons I mentioned first principles at the beginning is to find if this
                trend makes sense or not. </p>
            <h4><b>Be Always a Beginner: </b></h4>
            <p>
                Maybe Ethereum won't work, maybe it will, maybe Bitcoin is important, maybe it's not but none of that
                really matters because it will change the more you know, what matters is that you keep having the
                beginner mindset and be curious and learn about the technology, just don't be a maximalist, that also is
                not welcoming to people to space.</p>
