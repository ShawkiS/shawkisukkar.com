            <h1>Why I am Creating Zbuilders?</h1>
            <p>I was talking to a student at the University of Waterloo and I was asking him on how he got so good at
                building projects and products and one thing he mentioned that he build small projects for startups in
                his free time or in the weekend and he told me that one of the benefits is that you donâ€™t have to make a
                long commitment to get the experience of working at x and you get to work with the engineers there and
                get experiences with different technologies rather than working in one place for 6 months other than you
                can do that with other commitments and as I am searching for an internship and trying to find a way to
                get as many experiences as possible, I thought this is so cool, instead of getting one unique experience
                in 6 months, you get 6 unique experiences if you build one project a month and this where <b><a
                        href="http://zbuilders.io/">Zbuilders</a></b>
                project idea came from!
            </p>
            <p>Instead of working with 10 people for 4 or 6 months, you can get work with 10 people every month, instead
                of having one mentorship experience, you got mentorship from 6 people, instead of exploring one thing,
                you explored 6 things.
            </p>
            <p>My hope is that Zbuilders will help students to gain a lot of interesting experiences with mentorship and
                startups to build projects fastly by smart people and also instead of hiring interns right away, you can
                see how they perform in one project.
            </p>

            <p>I am building the product right now and I think it will be ready in the next three to four weeks so you
                can sign up <a href="http://zbuilders.io/">here</a> if you want to be an early user and if you want to
