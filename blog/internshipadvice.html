            <h1>Some Advice for your Next Internship</h1>
            <p>I am currently doing my 4th internship at <a href="https://confluxnetwork.org/">Conflux Network</a>,
                other than spending some months with
                other projects, startups, and programs, I failed a lot and learned a lot, and that what mattered to me,
                it was all a learning experience, if I didn't do those experiences I won't know the wrong things! the
                article has some stuff I learned that will help you to get more out
                of your internship!</p>
            <h4><b>Pre-Internship Part (If you didn't get an internship yet):</b></h4>
            <ul class="list">
                <li id="item">You should learn how to reach out that will get you more interviews, you should at least
                    cold reach
                    out a 100 people to get at the 5 offers at the end, you have to know that startups/companies won't
                    give you an internship only to learn, you have to show your potential and what value you're capable
                    of delivering.</li>
                <li id="item">If you're in a conference, think about a way to make a fast impression, most of the people
                    will take your resume and that's it so you have to do your research before to be able to hack them.
                </li>
                <li id="item">Don't just accept your first internship offer, go into details about what you'll work on,
                    who will
                    mentor you, and place culture, sometimes building things by yourself will make you grow more so
                    getting an internship won't be always the best option to grow.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><b>When you Get the Internship:</b></h4>
            <ul class="list">
                <li id="item">Meet everyone, you don't know who knows who and what you can get out of a meeting, if you
                    don't get
                    a mentor, try to get one, find someone who cares about you and who has the experience you want to
                    get.</li>
                <li id="item">If you get to intern at a startup, probably they're so busy and you won't be a priority so
                    you
                    should be driven and find something to work on by yourself and that's the only way that you'll get
                    the trust to work on important things.</li>
                <li id="item">If you are interning at a startup, probably they have some extra money for now and in the
                    soon
                    future they may not so you have to find things that make you important if you're planning to get a
                    job there.</li>
                <li id="item">Don't take very big projects, I am not saying you have to stay in your comfort zone, push
                    yourself
                    but you have to take things that can be delivered at the end of the internship.</li>
                <li id="item">Start building a soon as possible and take as much feedback as you can, maybe try to have
                    daily sync
                    with someone, for me after trying multiple ways, this one is the best that will allow you to get
                    constant feedback, you don't want only to get feedback when you kicked out.</li>
                <li id="item">Clear communication is much harder than you think, in the end, if you don't communicate
                    well with
                    your mentors and things don't get done that's your problem.</li>
                <li id="item">It requires some ego to get things done, get a reputation that you're a person who gets
                    things done,
                    if you lose your reputation it's hard to get back. </li>
                <li id="item">Read the DeepWork book, deep work will help you deliver, you have to be so focused,
                    everything else
                    during those months shouldn't be important, you should use Saturday and Sunday for learning the
                    things
                    you will need during the week, something else to learn is how to ask good questions, ask a lot of
                    them.</li>
                <li id="item">A large part of developing software is about figuring out how to use software libraries
                    and SDKs.
                    This is one of the biggest tricks to being a "10x" engineer: smartly taking advantage of stuff that
                    other people have built. back to the point deliver, it doesn't matter how many lines of code you
                    wrote, it's only what you deliver with using a library or not. </li>
                <li id="item">If you're in a research internship sometimes research becomes an infinite loop and you
                    don't get
                    something at the end, you should be focusing on setting a deliverable milestone so you earn some
                    credibility when you get it done!</li>
                <li id="item">Write some articles about things you're learning that will help you to get the position
                    you're
                    aiming for after the internship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may fail at the end and that's okay, you just have to reflect on what you've learned, keep going, be
                hard on yourself but not so hard that's won't be valuable, mostly people there expected you to fail too!
